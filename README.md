# Stock Market Data Analysis Application (this is a template)

## Authors
- Antoni Rajtar (@ar448467 on GitHub)

## Description
I will create a desktop application with the following functionalities:

## Core Features:
- **List of Companies for Analysis**: Users can select companies to analyze.
- **Bar or Line Charts**: Display stock prices over a specific time period.
- **Time Range Selection**: Users can choose to view data from the last month, year, 5 years, or 20 years.
- **Virtual Investment Portfolio**:
  - Users can create a virtual investment portfolio by adding stocks they own.
  - Track total portfolio value and gains/losses.

## Additional Features:

- **Advanced Filters and Company Search**:
  - Filter companies by industry, e.g., Healthcare, IT, Banking, etc.
  - Search for companies that meet specific criteria, such as those with annual price growth of at least 10%.

- **User Notes and Observations**:
  - Add notes to each company, e.g., investment strategy comments or key market events.

- **AI-Powered Stock Price Prediction**:
  - Analyze historical data, technical indicators (e.g., moving averages), and fundamental indicators like income statements and balance sheets.  - Fetch data using APIs, such as [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/).
                                                                                                                        
- **Financial Ratio Calculation**:
  - Include tools for calculating financial ratios (e.g., P/E ratio, ROI, debt-to-equity ratio, etc.) for in-depth company analysis.
